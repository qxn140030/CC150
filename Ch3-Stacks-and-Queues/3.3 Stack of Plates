Question: Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely
          start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. 
          SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. 
          SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack.
// not right answer...          
class SetOfStacks {
  List<Stack> stacks = new ArrayList<>();
  public int capacity;
  public SetOfStacks(int capacity) {
    this.capacity = capacity;
  }
  public void push(int val) {
    Stack last = stacks.get(stacks.size() - 1);
    if (last != null && last.size() < capacity) {
      last.push(val);
    } else {
      Stack stack = new Stack(capacity);
      stack.push(val);
      stacks.add(stack);
    }
  }
}
