We have the following method used in a chess game: boolean canMoveTo(int x, int y). This method is part of the Piece class and returns
whether or not the piece can move to position (x, y). Explain how you would test this method.

1, Extreme Case Validation (ensuring the program doesn't crash on bad input):
test with negative numbers for x and y;
test with x larger than the width;
test with y larger than the height;
test with a completely full board;
test with an empty or nearly empty board;
test with far more white pieces than black;
test with far more black pieces than white.
For the error cases, return false or throw an exception.
2, General Testing:
perform a reasonable coverage of different boards. test each piece against every other piece, in every possible direction.
The key is recognizing that we cannot test every possible scenario, so we must focus on the essential areas.
