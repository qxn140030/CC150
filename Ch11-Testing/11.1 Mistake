Find the mistake(s) in the following code:
unsigned int i;
for (i = 100; i >= 0; --i) 
    printf("%d\n", i);
    
two mistakes:
1, an unsigned int will always >= 0, the for loop will loop infinitely, it should be i > 0.
2, use %u in place of %d.

unsigned int i;
for (i = 100; i > 0; --i) 
    printf("%u\n", i);

it will print the list of all numbers from 100 to 1, in descending order.
