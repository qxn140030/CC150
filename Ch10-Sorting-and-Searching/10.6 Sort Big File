Imagine you have a 20GB file with one string pre line. Explain how you would sort the file.

The algorithm is known as external sort.
Given a size limit of 20 gigabytes, the interviewer donot want you to bring all the data into memory. We divide the file
into chuncks, which are x megabytes each, where x is the amount of memory we have available. Each chunk is sorted separately,
then merge them one by one, then save back to the file system.
