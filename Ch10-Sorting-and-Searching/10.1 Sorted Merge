You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, where A has a large enough buffer at the end to hold B. Write a method to merge
B into A in sorted order.

void merge(int[] a, in[] b, int m, int n) {
    int pa = m - 1;
    int pb = n - 1;
    int i = m + n - 1;
    while (pb >= 0) {
        if (pa >= 0 && a[pa] >= b[pb]) {
            a[i--] = a[pa--];
        } else {
            a[i--] = a[pb--];
        }
    }
}
